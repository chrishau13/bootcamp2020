      <h3>Christoper Hau</h3>

      <p> Hi! My name's Chris. I'm from Hong Kong. Before I came to City, I studied at the University

      of Reading doing accounting but found that I hated the course so I decided to swap to computer

      science. I'm studying online from Hong Kong still, but I'm looking forward to meet you all in 

      hopefully December of this year! </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Tic Tac Toe</h3>

    <p>

	My first programming project, concluding the two week Programming Bootcamp at 

	City (2020). I created a two player tic tac toe game. The goal of the game

        is to try and get either three crosses or circles in a row. The top of the
	
	window will also show whether it is player 1 or player 2's turn to draw.

	To draw a cross, you will need to hover over the desired location and press

	x on your keyboard. For a circle, press c. If you would like to restart the
	
	game, hover over the red restart button at the bottom of the window and press

	r on your keyboard. The code mostly consists of if statements and could be

	compressed more so I hope to improve on that in future.

    </p>
